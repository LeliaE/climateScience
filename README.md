# Weather over the years

This repository contains a weather analysis, comparing European countries over the span of over 250 years, dating back as far as 1763.
The analysis can be found in the [Weather_Report.ipynb](https://github.com/LeliaE/climateScience/blob/main/Weather_Report.ipynb), including a thorough description of the steps taken in order to achieve the results.

Open a terminal and run the following commands in order to clone the repository and enter its root directory:

```
git clone git@github.com:LeliaE/climateScience.git
cd climateScience
```


### 1. Create environment
Create an environment in the root directory like this:

```
python -m venv env
```


### 2. Activate environment
If you are using MacOS or Linux, run the following command to activate your environment:

## Data Ownership and Description:   
URL: http://noaa-ghcn-pds.s3.amazonaws.com/  
Data Owner: NOAAâ€™s National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI), a scientific agency that focuses on the weather conditions, atmosphere, oceans, and more. It collects real-time data from satellites, weather stations, etc.  
Format: .csv (one file per year and one file per station)    

## Information Contained:  
Data: Each row represents one station-day  
Time period: 260 years (~1763 - 2022)  


Interesting columns:   
PRCP = Precipitation (tenths of mm)  
SNOW = Snowfall (mm)  
SNWD = Snow depth (mm)  
TMAX = Maximum temperature (tenths of degrees C)  
TMIN = Minimum temperature (tenths of degrees C)  
TAVG = Average temperature (tenths of degrees C)  
TSUN = Daily total sunshine (minutes)  
AWND = Average daily wind speed (tenths of meters per second)  
WT** = Weather Type  
Any missing values: possible blanks  
Location: Europe (determined through the least missing values : Austria, Spain, England)  
Needs for data transformations:   
AWND = Average daily wind speed (tenths of meters per second)  
Classify on the Beaufort scale (0-12)  
TAVG = Average temperature (tenths of degrees C)  
Calculate difference in average from previous year  
(maybe also for other columns)  
PRCP = Precipitation (tenths of mm)  
Classify whether rain day or not (0, 1)  
SNOW = Snowfall (mm)  
Classify whether snow day or not (0, 1)  
WT** = Weather Type
